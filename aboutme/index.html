    <h2>Nicholas Berrett</h2>
    <p>Howdy Everyone, my name is Nicholas Berrett, feel free to call me whatever variation of Nick you've heard, I'll respond to them all. I'm a CIT Major in my 3rd year.
    Some of my hobbies include playing the Viola, singing, and going hiking in the nice cool weather we have here in Idaho. I'm originally from Gilbert, Arizona but I moved up here ot Idaho a few years back for School. 
    I do currently have a job, I'm working full time as a remote Network Administrator for a Fire Protection company down in Arizona. If i had to pick one thing I love most about BYU-Idaho would definitely be the Rick's Gardens, it's my absolute favorite place to study. 
    I'm currently taking this course both as it's required for my major but also so that I can have a better understanding into what some of my co-workers do. 
    I've been a member of the church my whole life, but I really started believing while I was preparing for a mission to Montana. 
    I can't wait to get to know you all and learn how to make these websites a little prettier. 
    </p>
