                    Jami and I first met in the Fall of 2019 at BYU-Idaho at an opening ward social. While we 
                    didn’t start dating for a few weeks, we quickly became friends, bonding over a shared love 
                    of baked goods and board games. We had our first date a few weeks after meeting at nature 
                    park where hours and conversation topics passed by without us realizing. From there we spent 
                    the next year dating and enjoying each other’s company as we went forward in our collective 
                    studies. It was about a year into dating each other that Jami decided to go and serve a mission, 
                    so in January of 2021 she did just that serving in the Iowa City mission. Jami and I wrote to 
                    each other throughout her mission, sharing stories and encouraging each other until we were 
                    reunited this last summer. From there it seemed like no time had passed as we talked and dated, 
                    rejoicing in seeing each other again. Finally, after almost 3 years of dating, I asked Jami to 
                    Marry me in the same spot that we had our first date, thankfully, as evident by the existence of 
                    this website, she said yes. We are now planning on getting married on December 29th this year in 
                    Gilbert, Arizona (for more information see the wedding details page).
