      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Jami and I first met in the Fall of 2019 at BYU-Idaho at an opening ward social. While we 
        didn’t start dating for a few weeks, we quickly became friends, bonding over a shared love 
        of baked goods and board games. We had our first date a few weeks after meeting at nature 
        park where hours and conversation topics passed by without us realizing. From there we spent 
        the next year dating and enjoying each other’s company as we went forward in our collective 
        studies. It was about a year into dating each other that Jami decided to go and serve a mission, 
        so in January of 2021 she did just that serving in the Iowa City mission. Jami and I wrote to 
        each other throughout her mission, sharing stories and encouraging each other until we were 
        reunited this last summer. From there it seemed like no time had passed as we talked and dated, 
        rejoicing in seeing each other again. Finally, after almost 3 years of dating, I asked Jami to 
        Marry me in the same spot that we had our first date, thankfully, as evident by the existence of 
        this website, she said yes. We are now planning on getting married on December 29th this year in 
        Gilbert, Arizona (for more information see the wedding details page).
